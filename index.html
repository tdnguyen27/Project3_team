    <h2>🔎 Across the Seas: How has the industrial era affected sea surface temperatures and calcite levels across 164 years?</h2>
    <h3>Throughout Earth's oceans, there seems to be a substantial rise in sea surface temperature reflecting global warming and a less substantial decline in calcite concentration with no visible fluctuating pattern.</h3>

      <h2>Write-Up</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>We chose to work with the CMIP6 dataset because we were most interested in time series analysis to discover plausible futures given the project model’s prediction data. We started off with the basis of visualizing sea surface temperature – we considered this as a starting point because a warming climate is a more familiar concern for the general population. However, we wanted to make it more interesting. The preliminary question we sought to ask was if warming sea temperatures abetted the degradation of another oceanic variable – specifically calcite (calcium carbonate) concentration. After some outside research we surmised that sea temperatures and calcite concentrations are indirectly related through ocean acidification. Warmer sea temperatures can hold more carbon dioxide which increases the acidity of seawater; in turn dissolving the calcium carbonate in the ecosystem. Marine organisms such as plankton, shellfish, and corals rely on calcite to form their shells and skeletons. We sought out to identify if this relationship exists in the simulated data of CMIP6.</p>
      <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
      <p>	For our data we were given longitude and latitude coordinates but directly plotting the temperature (or calcite concentration) value for every coordinate pair was unrealistic and mindless. So we decided to bin our coordinates into the five major oceans: Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern oceans. Then, further consolidate the data by taking the average over each region. So now we have one value for each year per ocean. However, in the calcite concentration data we had the additional variable of lev (ocean model level), so interpreting the data in our calcite variable we have one value for each year per a given lev value per ocean.</p>
      <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
      <p>Since we were performing time series analysis we went with a line chart to visually identify trends, patterns, or changes over the flow of time. Once that was decided we could easily do this for both sea surface temperatures and calcite concentration. However, we wanted to interactively correlate between the two charts; so, we decided on a slider to pinpoint interesting information the reader could find. For example, “what was the calcite concentration amount of the highest sea surface temperature in the Atlantic ocean?” and continuing questions like  “what year did this take place?”. We went with a slider rather than a click and hover because there are many years, you’d have to trace the line to find a specific year since you can’t see specific points. Also since there are many years plotted, the gap between tick marks is high making pinpointing a certain year and its corresponding temperature difficult, the slider helps readers with that. The dynamic tags that display the corresponding year, temperature, and calcite concentration also give precise values at a glance without forcing readers to estimate from the y-axis. In addition to the slider we incorporated a drop down selection menu on the calcite chart to allow the reader to peruse through how the data on calcite concentration changes with different ocean depths. The available data on ocean depth level is limited to the Sunlight Zone – between 1 and 200 meters deep – where marine life is most concentrated thanks to the easy entry of sunlight. With these interactions the reader can simply investigate the changing data holding a variable fixed (ocean region, ocean level, or year), and discover things like: in the Pacific Ocean, specifically, there seems to be no apparent trend in calcite concentration but as we increase the ocean depth – after 7500 – we can see there is a gradual decline in calcite concentration. Converting all this information into static charts we would need 15 calcite charts for every sea surface temperature chart per region – about 90 charts – just to portray all the same data we did interactively. The reader would not be able to make precise observations but rather only general, vague inspections due to visual clutter. To bring the two variables together and limit the number of charts on screen we created the map with mean sea surface temperature displayed. We decided to use a hover and click for the map so readers can focus on one region at a time and visually see how sea surface temperature tends to be in that region. We further made it easier for readers visually by binning the temperatures on the map rather than having a continuous gradient so readers can better see the temperature differences, which aligns with the visual encoding principles discussed in class. We also decided to use a diverging color scale, where the colors we chose are also intuitive for readers with hotter temperatures being red, colder temperatures being blue, and the middle ground “warm” temperatures being a light yellow. There was the alternative of creating buttons for each unique ocean and clicking one would render new charts – which is perfectly adequate – but we thought to be less enticing. With the map we are able to provide a reminder to the reader where the oceans are actually positioned in regards to each other and neighboring countries; readers are also reminded of how big the Pacific Ocean is compared to the rest, wrapping around to the other side. The map also makes it evident that the highest sea temperatures congregate around the middle of the map which makes sense because that is where the equator lies. So, the map isn’t only visually alluring but also recalls familiar knowledge that helps the reader better understand the data. </p>
      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <p>Our group decided to have each member do their own data exploration initially so we could have multiple ideas for our final project. Afterwards, we came together to pitch our ideas and settled on combining two of our ideas that correlated together and then created a shared repository to work on together. We took turns coding with one person working on the sea surface temperature visualization, one person working on calcite concentration, and one person working on the interactive design and overall website design. We spent roughly 45 hours on developing our visualizations and the most time was spent on syncing all of our different interactions together so they properly load with minimal bugs. About half the time we spent was on developing a working visualization with the rest of the time split between data cleaning and exploration, visual designs, and the writeup.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p> Our data visualization has shown us that there is an apparent increase in sea surface temperature across all oceans, but we cannot identify a relationship of this trend in temperature to calcite concentration. In certain oceans at certain ocean depths there is possibly an inverse relationship; however it is too sporadic for us to claim it as a generalization. We also cannot be meticulous in differentiating the different ocean depths because they are all a part of the sunlight zone which is not broken into subsections; we only know it as the uppermost layer. Therefore, we cannot even provide a sufficient explanation if a relationship between the two variables were to exist. Nevertheless, our visualization enables users to explore how simulated ocean temperatures and calcite concentrations have evolved over time and depth while emphasizing potential connections between climate change and marine chemistry.</p>
